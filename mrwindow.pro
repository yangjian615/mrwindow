; PURPOSE:
;+
;   The purpose of this program is to create zoomable, resizeable window in which plottable
;   objects (line plots, images, colorbars, text, arrows, etc.) can be held. Zooming and
;   analytical tools are available. CDF files can be plotted, as well.
;
; :Params:
;       PARENT:             in, optional, type=int
;                           The widget ID of a parent widget in which to place the draw
;                               window. If not provided, the draw window will be placed
;                               in a MrWindow widget unless `NOGUI`=1.
;
; :Keywords:
;       ARROWS:             in, optional, type=object/objarr
;                           MrArrow object(s) to be added to the diplay window.
;       BUFFER:             in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;                           If set, graphics will be directed to an invisible pixmap window
;                               instead of generating a widget window.
;       DRAW:               in, optional, type=boolean, default=1
;                           If set, the Draw method will be called. Widgets will be
;                               realized at this time.
;       NAME:               in, optional, type=string, default='MrWindow'
;                           Name to be given to the window. Windows can be accessed by
;                               name via the GetMrWindows function.
;       NOGUI:              in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;                           If set, graphics will be created in a normal IDL window, unless
;                               `PARENT` is provided.
;       PLOTOBJECTS:        in, optional, type=object/objarr
;                           MrPlot object(s) to be added to the display.
;       REFRESH:            in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;                           If set, the display will be refreshed after the window is
;                               created. This will cause the widget to be realized and
;                               the contents to be drawn.
;       SAVEDIR:            in, optional, type=string, default=current
;                           The directory in which to save files. When the display is
;                               saved via the ::saveImage method, if no filename is given,
;                               a dialog will open to this directory.
;       TEXT:               in, optional, type=object
;                           A weText object or an array of weText objects to be added
;                               to the draw window.
;       XSIZE:              in, optional, type=long, default=512
;                           The width of the draw window in pixels
;       YSIZE:              in, optional, type=long, default=512
;                           The height of the draw window in pixels
;       _REF_EXTRA:         in, optional, type=structure
;                           Any keyword accepted by the superclasses is also accepted for
;                               keyword inheritance.

;       06/29/2013  -   Written by Matthew Argall
;       07/05/2013  -   Was accidentally calling MrWindow::Init with _REF_EXTRA instead
;                           of _EXTRA. Fixed.
;       2014/01/22  -   Removed unused TEXT, PLOTOBJECTS, and ARROWS keywords - MRA
