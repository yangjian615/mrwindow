;       X:                  in, required, type=numeric
;                           A vector or scalar argument providing the X components of the
;                               points to be connected. If only one argument is specified,
;                               X must be an array of either two or three vectors
;                               (i.e., (2,*) or (3,*)). In this special case, X[0,*] are
;                               taken as the X values, X[1,*] are taken as the `Y` values,

;       Y:                  in, optional, type=numeric
;                           Y coordinate(s) of the points to be connected.

;                           Z coordinate(s) of the points to be connected.

;                           A MrColorFill object reference.
